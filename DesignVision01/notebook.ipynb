Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need and beauty to produce something that the world didn't know it was missing.\" —via [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/propointgraphics/2017/06/17/design-thinking-your-next-competitive-advantage/)\n",

      "1. Exploring the intersection of design and artificial intelligence: Antonelli could delve into the ways in which AI is shaping design processes and outcomes, and how designers can harness AI to create more innovative and sustainable solutions.\n",

      "2. Promoting design for social impact: Antonelli could focus on how design can address pressing social issues such as inequality, climate change, and access to healthcare. She could curate exhibitions and initiate projects that highlight design solutions that have a positive impact on communities and society as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Embracing immersive technologies: Antonelli could explore the potential of virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality in the realm of design. She could investigate how these technologies can enhance user experiences, transform design practices, and create new forms of interactive art and design.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Designing for space exploration and colonization: Given Antonelli's interest in design's interaction with life on other planets, she could delve into the field of space design. This could involve exploring how design can contribute to the development of sustainable habitats, efficient transportation systems, and innovative technologies for space exploration and colonization.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Redefining the boundaries of design: Antonelli could continue to challenge traditional notions of design by expanding its scope to include emerging fields such as bio-design, synthetic biology, and biomimicry. She could explore how design can learn from nature and integrate biological principles to create more sustainable and resilient solutions.\n",
      "\n",

    "Paola Antonelli joined The Museum of Modern Art in 1994 and is the Museum’s Senior Curator in the Department of Architecture and Design, as well as MoMA’s founding Director of Research and Development. Her work investigates design in all its forms, from architecture to video games, often expanding its reach to include overlooked objects and practices. Her exhibitions, lectures, and writings contemplate design’s intersection and interaction with other fields (from technology and biology to popular culture) and with life—that of individuals, communities, all species, and all planets. Her goal is to promote people’s understanding of design, until its positive influence on the world is universally acknowledged.\n",
    "An architect trained at the Polytechnic of Milan and a pasionaria of design, Antonelli has been named one of the 25 most incisive design visionaries in the world by TIME magazine, has earned the Design Mind Smithsonian Institution’s National Design Award, has been inducted in the US Art Directors Club Hall of Fame, and has received the AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Artists,) the London Design Medal, and the German Design Award, among other accolades.\n",

    "The first important exhibition at the museum curated by Antonelli opened in 1995 and was titled Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design. This was followed in 1996 by Thresholds: Contemporary Design from the Netherlands; Achille Castiglioni: Design! in 1997 (through 1998); Projects 66: Campana/Ingo Maurer in 1999; Open Ends and Matter (September 2000 – February 2001). Her 2001 exhibition Workspheres was devoted to the design of the workplace of the near future. In 2005 she curated the exhibition entitled Safe: Design Takes on Risk also at MoMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "She curated the exhibition entitled 'Safe' in 2005 based on her show at the International Design Conference in Aspen (August 20–23, 2003), similarly entitled 'Safe: Design Takes on Risk.'' Other recent projects include a book about food worldwide, as examples of distinctive design, and a television program on design. As a curator, Antonelli has added various video games to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art[6] and she has been attempting to include Boeing 747 in MoMA's permanent collection as well.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with Jamer Hunt, Antonelli established an installation entitled Design and Violence which focuses on the physical representation of some of humanity's most prominent features, such as sex, aggression, and smelliness. One piece, for example, is a vial of synthetic sweat. Of the exhibit, Antonelli says, 'We wanted objects that have an ambiguous relationship with violence. Each object—an outline of a drone, a self-guided bullet, a stiletto—is selected to highlight both the beneficial and also destructive side of design. Design is multidimensional nowadays, and Antonelli and Hunt aimed to represent this.[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017, Antonelli and Michelle Millar Fisher curated 'Items: Is Fashion Modern?', an exhibition that explores 111 items of clothing and accessories that have had a strong impact on the world in the 20th and 21st centuries[9] and taught a related massive open online course (MOOC) titled Fashion as Design.\n",
    "In an exhibit featuring video games such as Pac-Man, Tetris, and Minecraft, viewers are intended to actually play the games to showcase the interaction design of these products. The Guardian, for example, responded, 'Sorry MoMA, Video Games Are Not Art'\n",
